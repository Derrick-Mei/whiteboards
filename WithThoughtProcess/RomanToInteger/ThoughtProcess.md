Roman numerals are calculate using an addition system where the individual units are summed together
  from largest on the left to smallest on right

so we can loop over all the roman numerals and sum up the total.

However, to make things shorter, the numeral 10% smaller to the numerals of powers of 10 are written using shorthand
  by placing the numeral 10% smaller than it to it's left

those combined-numerals can be read as x from y.  These cases are distinct in that the following numeral is bigger vs
  the pattern that the numbers get smaller from left to right.

therefore, to calculate those, a numeral should be added to the sum unless following numeral is bigger.  In that case, subtract that numeral
